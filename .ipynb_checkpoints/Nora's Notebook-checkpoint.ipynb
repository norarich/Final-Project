    "##### For this project, we are required to find some metric that will determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Our approach to finding our metric was to orignially come up wit ideas and then find datasets that applied. Our first idea was \"best neighborhood to have a glow-up\" or \"best neighborhood to raise a family\" However, this proposed to be a challenge because the datasets are limited in what they cover. We struggled to find datasets that were applicable to these metrics. However, we did notice that there is a lot of data regarding traffic and roadways in Pittsburgh neighborhoods. For this reason, we knew we wanted to do something with this information, but also for our metric to be intersting. That is how we decided on our metric \"best neighborhood to film Cars 4\". "

The features we are measuring based on this metric are number of speed bumps, number of traffic lights, and number of bridges per neighborhood. In our idea of Cars 4, there should be the least number of speed bumps and traffic lights, but more bridges. For these reasons, we are reviewing datasets that cover speed bumps, traffic lights, and city bridges."
